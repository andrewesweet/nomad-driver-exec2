## Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis examines the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) Section 404 requirements for internal control over financial reporting, with specific focus on IT separation, segregation, and isolation requirements relevant to multi-tenant containerized financial services infrastructure. The analysis follows the Meta-Regulatory Analysis Framework v1.8.0 methodology, applying STRIDE-enhanced keyword searches while excluding human-to-machine interactions from scope.

### Key Findings Summary
- **Primary Sources Analyzed**: 4 regulatory documents
- **Total Separation Requirements Identified**: [To be determined through systematic analysis]
- **STRIDE Threat Categories Covered**: All 6 categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)
- **Multi-Tenant Relevance**: High - SOX requirements directly applicable to containerized financial reporting systems
- **Implementation Priority**: Critical for financial services compliance

## 1. Analysis Methodology

- **Scope Exclusions**: Human-to-machine interactions excluded per framework v1.8.0
- **Source Tracking**: UTC timestamp format for all source access documentation
- **Legal-Style Numbering**: Consistent 1.2.3 format throughout analysis

### 1.2 STRIDE-Enhanced Keyword Strategy

**Traditional Separation Keywords**:
- separat/separation, segregat/segregation, isolat/isolation
- physical, logical, network, hardware, memory
- tenant/multi-tenant/multi-tenancy, application/applications, workload/workloads
- environment, infrastructure, computing, resource

**STRIDE-Enhanced Keywords**:
- **Spoofing**: authentication, identity, verification
- **Tampering**: integrity, modification, unauthorized changes
- **Repudiation**: audit, logging, non-repudiation
- **Information Disclosure**: confidentiality, privacy, unauthorized access
- **Denial of Service**: availability, service continuity, resilience
