## 4. Thematic Consolidation Framework

### 4.1 Unified Requirement Categories

#### 4.1.1 Primary Separation Categories
Based on DORA analysis findings, establish consistent categories across all regulations:

**1. Environment Separation**
- Production vs. non-production isolation
- Testing environment separation
- Development environment controls
- Staging and pre-production separation

**2. Access Control Separation**
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for systems and applications
- Segregation of duties between technical systems and processes
- Privileged access management for technical accounts and service identities
- Need-to-know access principles for system-to-system communications

**Scope Exclusion**: Human-to-machine interactions such as segregation of duties for human users and privileged access management for humans are excluded from this analysis. Focus is on technical infrastructure controls and system-to-system access management.

**3. Network and Infrastructure Separation**
- Network segmentation and isolation
- Physical infrastructure separation
- Logical network controls
- Inter-system communication controls

**4. Data Separation and Protection**
- Data classification and handling
- Cross-border data transfer controls
- Data processing location requirements
- Data retention and disposal separation

**5. Organizational and Operational Separation**
- Third-party service provider separation
- Vendor and subcontractor isolation
- Intra-group vs. external separation
- Operational function segregation

**6. Geographic and Jurisdictional Separation**
- Data residency requirements
- Cross-border processing restrictions
- Jurisdictional compliance boundaries
- Regional regulatory variations

**7. Threat Actor and Risk Management Requirements**
- Specific threat actors that must be considered in risk assessments
- Nation-state and advanced persistent threat (APT) requirements
- Insider threat and malicious actor considerations
- Threat modeling and risk analysis mandates
- Controls required for specific threat actor categories

#### 4.1.2 Cross-Regulation Mapping Matrix
**Structure**: Map each regulation's requirements to unified categories
**Format**: Spreadsheet/table with regulations as columns, categories as rows
**Content**: Specific requirement references and compliance levels

| Category | EU DORA | EU GDPR | EU MiFID II | UK OR | US SR 13-19 | PCI DSS |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Environment Separation | Art. 25(1,3) | Art. 25 | Art. 16(2) | PS6/21 Ch.3 | Section 3.2 | Req. 6.4 |
| Access Control Separation | Art. 8(2)(a) | Art. 32(1)(b) | Art. 16(3) | PS6/21 Ch.4 | Section 4.1 | Req. 7.1 |
| Threat Actor Requirements | TBD* | Art. 32(1) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

*Note: DORA analysis may require re-analysis to identify specific threat actor requirements

#### 4.1.3 Requirement Hierarchy and Prioritization
**Priority Levels**:
1. **MUST**: Mandatory regulatory requirements with enforcement
2. **SHOULD**: Recommended practices with regulatory guidance
3. **MAY**: Optional implementations with regulatory recognition
4. **CONDITIONAL**: Requirements triggered by specific circumstances

**Criticality Assessment**:

- Standardize requirement language and terminology
- Assign unique identifiers to each requirement

**Step 2: Similarity Analysis**
- Identify overlapping requirements across regulations
- Group similar requirements by functional area
- Analyze differences in scope, applicability, and implementation

**Step 3: Conflict Resolution**
- Identify conflicting requirements between regulations
- Determine most restrictive requirement where conflicts exist
- Document regulatory precedence and jurisdiction considerations

**Step 4: Gap Analysis**
- Identify areas covered by some but not all regulations
- Highlight unique requirements specific to individual regulations
- Assess coverage completeness across all separation categories

#### 4.2.2 Implementation Complexity Assessment
**Technical Complexity Factors**:
- Implementation effort (Low/Medium/High)
- Technical dependencies and prerequisites
- Integration complexity with existing systems
- Testing and validation requirements

**Operational Complexity Factors**:
- Process changes required
- Training and competency requirements
- Ongoing monitoring and maintenance

### A.6 Source Tracking Methodology
**Comprehensive Documentation Requirements**:
- **Primary Sources**: Fully analyzed regulatory documents with complete analysis
- **Secondary Sources**: Partially reviewed for context and metadata
- **Sources Not Accessed**: Identified but not analyzed with clear rationale
- **Source Metadata**: URI, document type, accessed on timestamp (UTC), analysis status, relevance, notes
- **Analysis Completeness**: Percentage metrics with transparency on coverage limitations

### A.7 Implementation Context for Milo Plugin
**Multi-Tenant Security Design Requirements**:
- **Traditional Separation**: Physical/logical boundaries, environment isolation, network segregation
- **STRIDE-based Security**: Identity verification, integrity controls, audit mechanisms, confidentiality protection, availability assurance, privilege management
- **Technical Infrastructure Focus**: Detailed architectural guidance for VMs, containers, service meshes, orchestration systems
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Systematic methodology for analyzing requirements across all target jurisdictions

### A.8 Key Methodological Insights
**Successful Analysis Patterns**:
- **Legal-style numbering** (1.2.3 format) essential for regulatory analysis organization
- **Keyword methodology** must include "tenant", "multi-tenant", "multi-tenancy" alongside traditional separation terms
- **Source tracking appendices** critical for regulatory compliance verification and audit trails
- **Technical infrastructure prioritization** over process concerns aligns with plugin development needs
- **STRIDE threat model integration** provides comprehensive security separation coverage

**Repository Organization**:
- **Branch Strategy**: Continue work on existing branches rather than creating new PRs
- **File Structure**: Hierarchical organization by jurisdiction/authority/regulation
- **Version Control**: Preserve all analysis stages without overwriting initial work
- **Documentation Standards**: Consistent formatting, precise source attribution, comprehensive appendices
