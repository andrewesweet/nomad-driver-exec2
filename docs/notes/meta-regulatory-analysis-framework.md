#### 4.1.2 Cross-Regulation Mapping Matrix
**Structure**: Map each regulation's requirements to unified categories
**Format**: Spreadsheet/table with regulations as columns, categories as rows
**Content**: Specific requirement references and compliance levels

| Category | EU DORA | EU GDPR | EU MiFID II | UK OR | US SR 13-19 | PCI DSS |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Environment Separation | Art. 25(1,3) | Art. 25 | Art. 16(2) | PS6/21 Ch.3 | Section 3.2 | Req. 6.4 |
| Access Control Separation | Art. 8(2)(a) | Art. 32(1)(b) | Art. 16(3) | PS6/21 Ch.4 | Section 4.1 | Req. 7.1 |

**Priority Levels**:
1. **MUST**: Mandatory regulatory requirements with enforcement
2. **SHOULD**: Recommended practices with regulatory guidance
3. **MAY**: Optional implementations with regulatory recognition
4. **CONDITIONAL**: Requirements triggered by specific circumstances

**Criticality Assessment**:
- **Critical**: Non-compliance results in significant penalties/sanctions
- **High**: Non-compliance results in regulatory action/remediation
- **Medium**: Non-compliance results in regulatory attention/monitoring
- **Low**: Non-compliance results in recommendations/guidance

### 4.2 Consolidation Methodology

#### 4.2.1 Requirement Harmonization Process
**Step 1: Requirement Extraction**

- Standardize requirement language and terminology
- Assign unique identifiers to each requirement

**Step 2: Similarity Analysis**
- Identify overlapping requirements across regulations
- Group similar requirements by functional area
- Analyze differences in scope, applicability, and implementation

**Step 3: Conflict Resolution**
- Identify conflicting requirements between regulations
- Determine most restrictive requirement where conflicts exist
- Document regulatory precedence and jurisdiction considerations

**Step 4: Gap Analysis**
- Identify areas covered by some but not all regulations
- Highlight unique requirements specific to individual regulations
- Assess coverage completeness across all separation categories

#### 4.2.2 Implementation Complexity Assessment
**Technical Complexity Factors**:
- Implementation effort (Low/Medium/High)
- Technical dependencies and prerequisites
- Integration complexity with existing systems
- Testing and validation requirements

**Operational Complexity Factors**:
- Process changes required
- Training and competency requirements
- Ongoing monitoring and maintenance
- Compliance verification procedures

**Business Impact Factors**:
- Cost of implementation
