# Meta-Regulatory Analysis Framework: Plan of Plans

## Document Information
- **Title**: Meta-Framework for Multi-Regulation IT Separation Requirements Analysis
- **Purpose**: Systematic approach for analyzing multiple financial services regulations
- **Created**: June 15, 2025
- **Based on**: DORA Analysis Experience (48 separation requirements identified)

This meta-framework establishes a systematic methodology for analyzing multiple financial services regulations to identify IT separation requirements. Building on the successful DORA analysis that identified 48 specific separation requirements across 6 phases, this framework enables:

1. **Standardized Analysis**: Consistent methodology across different regulatory sources
2. **Comparative Assessment**: Systematic comparison of requirements between regulations
3. **Thematic Consolidation**: Unified requirement categories spanning multiple regulations
4. **Version Control**: Preservation of all analysis stages and iterations
5. **Implementation Guidance**: Actionable requirements for multi-tenant security design

- Vendor and subcontractor isolation
- Intra-group vs. external separation
- Operational function segregation

**6. Geographic and Jurisdictional Separation**
- Data residency requirements
- Cross-border processing restrictions
- Jurisdictional compliance boundaries
- Regional regulatory variations

**7. Threat Actor and Risk Management Requirements**
- Specific threat actors that must be considered in risk assessments
- Nation-state and advanced persistent threat (APT) requirements
- Insider threat and malicious actor considerations
- Threat modeling and risk analysis mandates
- Controls required for specific threat actor categories

#### 4.1.2 Cross-Regulation Mapping Matrix
**Structure**: Map each regulation's requirements to unified categories
**Format**: Spreadsheet/table with regulations as columns, categories as rows
**Content**: Specific requirement references and compliance levels

| Category | EU DORA | EU GDPR | EU MiFID II | UK OR | US SR 13-19 | PCI DSS |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Environment Separation | Art. 25(1,3) | Art. 25 | Art. 16(2) | PS6/21 Ch.3 | Section 3.2 | Req. 6.4 |
| Access Control Separation | Art. 8(2)(a) | Art. 32(1)(b) | Art. 16(3) | PS6/21 Ch.4 | Section 4.1 | Req. 7.1 |
| Threat Actor Requirements | TBD* | Art. 32(1) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

*Note: DORA analysis may require re-analysis to identify specific threat actor requirements

#### 4.1.3 Requirement Hierarchy and Prioritization
**Priority Levels**:
1. **MUST**: Mandatory regulatory requirements with enforcement
2. **SHOULD**: Recommended practices with regulatory guidance
3. **MAY**: Optional implementations with regulatory recognition
4. **CONDITIONAL**: Requirements triggered by specific circumstances

**Criticality Assessment**:
- **Critical**: Non-compliance results in significant penalties/sanctions
- **High**: Non-compliance results in regulatory action/remediation
- **Medium**: Non-compliance results in regulatory attention/monitoring
- **Low**: Non-compliance results in recommendations/guidance

### 4.2 Consolidation Methodology

#### 4.2.1 Requirement Harmonization Process
**Step 1: Requirement Extraction**
- Extract all separation requirements from individual regulation analyses
- Standardize requirement language and terminology
- Assign unique identifiers to each requirement

**Step 2: Similarity Analysis**
- Identify overlapping requirements across regulations
- Group similar requirements by functional area
- Analyze differences in scope, applicability, and implementation

**Step 3: Conflict Resolution**
- Identify conflicting requirements between regulations
- Determine most restrictive requirement where conflicts exist
- Document regulatory precedence and jurisdiction considerations

**Step 4: Gap Analysis**
- Identify areas covered by some but not all regulations
- Highlight unique requirements specific to individual regulations
- Assess coverage completeness across all separation categories

#### 4.2.2 Implementation Complexity Assessment
**Technical Complexity Factors**:
- Implementation effort (Low/Medium/High)
- Technical dependencies and prerequisites
- Integration complexity with existing systems
- Testing and validation requirements

**Operational Complexity Factors**:
- Process changes required
- Training and competency requirements
- Ongoing monitoring and maintenance
- Compliance verification procedures

**Business Impact Factors**:
- Cost of implementation
- Timeline for compliance
- Business process disruption
- Competitive advantage/disadvantage
